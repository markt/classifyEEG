# neuroIN (neuroImageNets)

neuroIN is a deep learning package for neuroimaging data.

The basic workflow for neuroIN is:
-process EEG (other modalities to come) data into image and video like arrays
-initialize an architecture for your data
-train network and optimize hyperparameters
-visualize results and network features
